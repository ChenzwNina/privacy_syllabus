You are an assistant tasked with identifying the URLs of readings in a syllabus.

# Input Fields
(1) You are provided with a dataframe which contains readings under "Reading Name".

## How to Find Right URL that Matches Reading
(1) First, Search for each Reading Name (from the dataframe) in the parsed syllabus text.
(2) After finding the Reading Name in the syllabus, look for the abbreviation URL (e.g., url_1) that usually follows the name.
(3) Add the found URL to the corresponding reading in the "URL" field. If a reading has multiple URLs (though rare), include all URLs in the "URL" field.

## Output Format Instruction
Provide the output as a list of JSON objects (one per reading), without any introductory text or summaries.

Each reading should be a JSON object with two fields: Reading Name and URL. Get If any information is missing, use an empty string "".
(1) Get Reading Name from the dataframe into the "Reading Name" field.
(2) Add the mapped url to the "URL" field.
